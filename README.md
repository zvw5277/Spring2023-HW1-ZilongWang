# Read these instructions carefully.


**If you don't, you are likely to mess up the github repository and waste a lot of time from a lot of people (including yourself). If you skip reading this and just ask questions on stackoverflow, you will get the wrong answer and will mess up your repository.**

**Do Not clone the starter code repository, that is not what you want to do**


# Access Tokens

Github does not allow password authentication from the command line. Instead, you will need to use an access token in place of a password. To learn how to make one, go here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token (make sure to set expiration date after the semester and final are over, and make sure to set the permissions for the token appropriately).

To avoid typing in your access token all the time, type this in the command line: ```git config --global credential.helper store```
and then git will then remember your credentials after the next time you use them.

# startercode
For a nicely formatted version of this file, go to: https://github.com/psu-ds410/startercode-Spring2023/blob/main/README.md

This repository contains the starter code for all of the homeworks for DS 410 to be used with Github Classroom.

To create/clone your github classroom repository, see the **cloning a repository** section of this document.

# First use

First, clone your github classroom respository from "cloning a repository" section below.

The first time you clone a github classroom repository, type the following in a linux shell (in the directory containing your github repository):

```source ./setup```

This will allow you to receive updates to this repository. If you are not using linux, type the following into the git shell:

```git remote add staff2 https://github.com/psu-ds410/startercode-Spring2023```

# Updates

Whenever you are notified to update the starter code, type the following in a linux shell (in the directory containing your github respository):

```source ./updatestarter```

This will pull the updates from the startercode repository. If you are not using linux, type the following into the git shell:

```git pull staff2 main --allow-unrelated-histories```

These actions may require you to merge any conflicts (so make sure you are familiar with the git instructions later in this README file).

Once merge conflicts (if any) are resolved, make sure to ```git push```

If you mess up the merge and want to download the updates manually, visit https://github.com/psu-ds410/startercode-Spring2023/ to find the recently changed code and download it.

# Git basics

Git is a popular distributed version control system. There is a very nice online book that explains how to use it https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 . A distributed version control system allows you to update your code so you **don't** have to create mycode.py,  mycode_v2.py, mycode_v3.py, etc. to keep track of your code's history. Git manages the history of your code.

If you are using a non-linux system, make sure to install git and then use the git shell to type in commands.

A typical basic workflow in git is:
* Initialization: use **git clone** to download the repository on your computer the first time.
* **git pull** before you edit your files. This ensures you get the latest versions of the file from github.com
* **git status** to see which files you have changed (in case you forget)
* **git add** to stage the files you changed
* **git commit** to update your local repository with the staged files
* **git push** to update your remote repository (the one that is stored on github.com). This will ensure your work is saved even if your computer explodes in a freak accident involving coffee, division by 0, and an asteroid impact.

You can clone a repository on many computers and use them to push changes to the remote repository. In order to synchronize all of these local repositories, you can use **git pull** to download the latest changes. If these changes conflict with yours, you will need to **merge** the changes.

## Cloning a repository (git clone)

Cloning a repository is basically the same as downloading it to your computer for the first time.
The command is 

```git clone [source] [destination]```

For this course, your repository will be created after you accept the assignment at https://classroom.github.com/a/N7-QpWpv .
The source will be https://github.com/psu-ds410/hw-Spring2023-[github-username].git and you can use ds410hw as the destination. For example, I would clone the homework repository as:

```git clone https://github.com/psu-ds410/hw-Spring2023-dkifer.git ds410hw```

(obviously you need to change this a little since your github user name is different than mine).

Once you have cloned a repository, you don't need to clone it again (unless you deleted it from your computer).

**Important** you can also access your repository on the web: https://github.com/psu-ds410/hw-Spring2023-[your-github-username]
which is useful because it shows the contents of your remote repository.

## Staging files (git status and git add)

Let's say I edited some files such as hello.py and world.py. These files need to be staged. This can be done by typing

```git add hello.py world.py```

If you don't remember which files you edited, type

```git status``` 

to see the list.

**Important:** only stage the files you really need (i.e., your source code). **Do not** stage auto-generated files like hello.pyc (since these files are automatically generated by python) and do not stage binary files (i.e., only stage text files like source code).

**Important #2** if you stage a file, and then edit it, you need to stage it again. When you later commit your changes, git will only look at what has been staged. If you edit a file, stage the file, then edit it again (and forget to stage again), ony the first set of edits will be committed.

**Important #3** do not git add a directory (do not do ```git add mydirectory/``` and do not do ```git add *```. List out the specific files, like ```git add mydirectory/myfile.py```

## Committing files (git commit)

After files are staged, you can use git commit to update (save to) your local repository.
Simpy type

```git commit -m "commit message"```

Make the commit message informative to describe what your recent file edits did.
**Important** you are not listing the files to commit. That has already been done when you staged the files.

## Pushing updates (git push)

Committing a your changes only updates your file history on your local machine. In order to save it on the github servers, you need to push the changes using

``` git push origin main```

(sometimes just typing ```git push``` is enough)

## Pulling updates (git pull)

If you have clones of your repositories on different computers, some of them will be out of date. Use 

```git pull origin main``` 

to download the latest changes into your local repository. It is a good idea to git pull before git push.

## Merging conflicts (merge)

Sometimes the changes you pull will conflict with what is on your local repository. For example, 
* on computer 1, you edit hello.py, commit it, then **git push**.
* on computer 2, you then edit hello.py in a different way and commit it. These changes could potentially conflict with the changes in computer 1. Git will not allow you to push this changes directly. It will instruct you to first **git pull** so that the changes you pushed from computer 1 are downloaded onto computer 2. You will then need to edit hello.py on computer 2 to merge in those changes. Finally, you will git add, commit, push the merged changes.

Here is an example of what you might see when there is a merge conflict. Open the file that has a conflict (hello.py). You will see something like this:

```
def greet():
    print("hello world")

<<<<<<< HEAD
def new_function_in_local_repository():
    return 1+1==2
=======
def new_function_in_remote_repository():
    pass
>>>>>>> 3a46f859a1a76724972a9e54e3b14b9d7c9dcd59

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet()
```

The code in between <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= is the code in my local repository that is not in the remote (on github.com). The code in between ======= and >>>>>>> 3a46f859a1a76724972a9e54e3b14b9d7c9dcd59
is the code that is in the remote repository but I did not have locally. 

It is your decision on how to fix this conflict. Here, I might decide that I want to keep both functions, so I will edit the file to look like this:

```
def greet():
    print("hello world")

def new_function_in_local_repository():
    return 1+1==2

def new_function_in_remote_repository():
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet()
```

then I will stage and commit:

```
git add hello.py
git commit -m "merged hello.py"
git push
```

## git branches

Branches are a useful part of git, especially when collaborating on a team. A typical workflow is to create a branch, add a new feature to your code, test it, commit the branch, and then merge it onto the main branch. To learn about branching, the linked book at the start of this section is a good place to start.


# Proper/Improper uses of github

- Github is only for files generated by humans and designed to be edited by humans (the reason is that it keeps track of changes among all the versions of the files you commit).
   - This includes code you write
   - This includes small test files
   - This DOES NOT include stuff you don't recognize. 
   - When you git add files, add them by name (not by directory and do not use *)
- The github repository has a file called .gitignore. 
   - you can edit it (don't forget to add/push/commit) to tell it which files should never be in the github repository
   - for example, adding the line *.pyc will make git ignore all files that end in .pyc
   - these files will no longer show up when you type ```git status```
   - on linux and Mac shell, files that start with . do not show up unless you type ```ls -al``` in the command prompt
   - Windows also likes to hide files that start with . (you may need to tell it to show hidden files)
